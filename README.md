# Hand-DIgit-Recognition-Using-CNN-
----------------------------------
Brief - 
-----
Trained a CNN model on the MNIST dataset, using tensorflow as backend and implmented a GUI for user to choose various options for predicting the result.

Details of Project -
------------------
1. Used Convolutional Neural Networks to predict handwritten digits.
2. Wrote the Convolutional Neural Network in tensorflow (Python).
3. The code trains the CNN model and saves its checkpoint in dir.
4. Another image processing code using OpenCV restores the saved checkpoint while making predictions (Python).
5. User can either -
  a. Upload an image
  b. Capture an image
  c. Display an image
  d. Draw an image by gesture
6. User interaction is handled using PyGtk 3.0.
